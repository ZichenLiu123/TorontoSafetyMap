# Toronto Crime Hotspots Visualization

Toronto is often negatively regarded in terms of its safety. Many classmates feel like it is unsafe to travel by themselves at night or even during the day. It would be beneficial to visualize the "hotspots" in Toronto, where the crime rates are the highest, so people can either avoid or be more alert when going through the area.

## Overview

This project aims to visualize the crime hotspots in Toronto using geospatial data. By aggregating and analyzing crime data, we aim to identify areas with the highest crime rates and represent them visually on a map. This visualization will help residents and visitors alike to be more informed about potentially risky areas in Toronto and take appropriate precautions when traveling through them.

## Data Sources

- Crime data: The project utilizes publicly available crime data from [https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/police-annual-statistical-report-homicide/] to analyze and visualize crime incidents in Toronto.

## Tools and Technologies
